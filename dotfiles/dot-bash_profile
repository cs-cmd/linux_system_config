# This script is ran when the Bash shell is launched as an interactive login
# shell. It is normally executed once and should probably source the `.bashrc`
# file, too.

# Source interactive shell script on startup, if it exists
# `-n` returns a boolean on whether the length of the string is non-zero, and
# `-r` returns a boolean on whether the file exists and is readable.

# TODO: `$BASH` may not always be pointing to the Bash executable. In some 
# insane instances, some [EXPLETIVE] may set the `$BASH` env variable to 
# something else. In most instances, this won't happen, though.
